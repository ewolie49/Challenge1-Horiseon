<!--Most of the changes have been made to this section
1. Change <div class="header"> to <header> and as result amend .header in CSS
2. Amend the <div> within the header to make clear that it is <nav> 
3. Inclusion of <main> tag
4. Div class="hero" contains a background image. I have considered whether an alt text would be required. I beleive that
from an accesible perspective is not needed given the image is purely derocative and removing it from the page would cause
 no impact to the page´s meaning or function. 
5. Creation of id="search-engine-optimization" to ensure the link in the Nav works
6. Amend from <div class="content" to "section" 
7. Amend from <div> to <article> on the 3 articles within the section and also created a new class called "articles" 
    because the 3 articles shared the same properties
8. Inclusion of alt text on the images inside the articles
9. Amend <div benefits> and created and <aside>. Within the aside, I created a new class called benefits as the 3 benefits
    shared the same features
10.Amend the <div class="footer"> and create a <footer> tag.
