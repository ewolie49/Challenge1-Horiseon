## Description
This project is the first Challenge of the bootcamp.
It is a very good exercise to practise everything that we have been studying during this last week.
The challenge consists on refactoring a code that has been provided to us. The visual result of the original page is good,
however, the code sitting behind is not up to date with the latest accesibility requirements.

It has been a challenging project as I am still getting up to speed with the basic concepts and I was struggling where to begin,
but after some time and a lot of research, I think I have managed to create a well structured code that I am proud of.

It really helped me to get a better understabnding of the basic structure of a website. 
A very interesting point that I have learnt has to do with the use of alt text for background images. There does not seem to be a definitive answer,
but the direction I took in the end was not to include any description given the Hero image was not fundamental for the structure/understanding of the website.
